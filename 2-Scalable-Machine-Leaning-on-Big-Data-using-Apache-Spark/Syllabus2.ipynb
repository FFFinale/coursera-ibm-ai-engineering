    "## Week 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to Apache Spark. You'll learn how Apache Spark internally works and how to use it for data processing. RDD, the low level API is introduced in conjunction with parallel programming / functional programming. Then, different types of data storage solutions are contrasted. Finally, Apache Spark SQL and the optimizer Tungsten and Catalyst are explained.\n",
